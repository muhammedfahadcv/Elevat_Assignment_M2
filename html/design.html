  <h4>front end design</h4>
 <p> Front-end design is a collaborative effort, so if you enjoy working with others as much as you enjoy development, it could be a good fit.</p>
  
 <p> Most Front-End Developers and Engineers coordinate with user experience (UX) teams. These folks determine the target demographic for the website and how users might interact with it.</p>
  
 <p> Graphic design is another critical part of front-end design. It includes fonts and colors, and ensures that the websiteâ€™s design matches the company and product the web application is for. This often comes from the research and branding team. For example, Amazon has a distinct logo, the same fonts used throughout, and consistent colors.</p>
  
 <p> Front-End Developers coordinate with various departments to ensure web applications work across all browsers and screen sizes, including phones and tablets. They may also receive feedback from these departments throughout development, so they need to be able to incorporate and listen to feedback from a variety of people with different perspectives and priorities.</p>
