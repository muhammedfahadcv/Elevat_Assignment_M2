  <h5> front end important</h5>
<p>In the video above, Pat explains that the front end is important because:

“It’s the digital representation of a company, or an individual, or an organization. It builds a bridge between a customer or client and the brand.”

If a website or application has an issue, it reflects poorly on the brand.

The front end is also what makes a website usable. If a website or application doesn’t work well, it can push customers away, and those customers can be difficult to win back.

Ultimately, the front end represents someone’s idea, and it’s important to do it justice.</p>

<h5>Becoming a Front-End Engineer</h5>
<p>One option for becoming a Front-End Engineer or Developer is to get a degree. While that’s a good fit for some, getting a degree isn’t practical for everyone. Fortunately, you can become a Front-End Engineer without a degree.

To do that, you’ll want to start by taking relevant courses. You could start with programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Or, you could check out our Front-End Engineer Career Path. Each Career Path provides a series of courses that take you from a beginner to ready to interview.

The Front-End Engineer Career Path includes the languages listed above, along with libraries like React and Redux. You’ll learn the basics of web design, including wireframing and color theory. You’ll build projects that you can include in your portfolio. You’ll also learn what to expect in a technical interview.</p>
